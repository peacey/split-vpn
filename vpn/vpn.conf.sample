# This does not include routed traffic, only local traffic generated by the UDM.
# Do not enable this unless you want to force UDM local traffic through the VPN.
# For UDM-Pro, set to "eth8" for WAN1/Ethernet port, or "eth9" for WAN2/SFP+ port, 
# or "eth8 eth9" for both. For UDM Base, set to "eth1" for the WAN port.
# This option might cause unintended problems, so disable it if you encounter any issues.

# IP sets can be updated externally and will be matched dynamically.
# Each IP set entry consists of the IP set name and whether to match on source

#
# Enable NAT hairpin by exempting UBIOS_ADDRv4_ethX:dst for IPv4 or
# UBIOS_ADDRv6_ethX:dst for IPv6 (where X = 8 for RJ45, or 9 for SFP+ WAN).
# For IPv6 prefix delegation, exempt UBIOS_ADDRv6_brX, where X = VLAN number (0 = LAN).
#
# To allow communication with your VLAN subnets without hardcoding the subnets,
# exempt the UBIOS_NETv4_brX:dst ipset for IPv4 or UBIOS_NETv6_brX:dst for IPv6.

# access at system startup before the VPN script runs. This option removes the blackhole 
# routes to restore Internet access after the killswitch has been enabled. 
# If you do not set this to 1, openvpn will not be able to connect at startup, and your

# "203" for U-LTE.
# Default is "auto" which works with WAN failover and automatically changes the endpoint
# via gateway route when the WAN or gateway routes changes.
# Set to "disabled" if you are using the nexthop option to connect to a VPN on your LAN.

# Set the MSS clamping on packets going out the VPN tunnel. Usually, it is not needed to

# To execute commands when the VPN connects or disconnects, you can use the 
# callback functions hooks_pre_up, hooks_up, hooks_down, and 
# hooks_force_down. These functions will be invoked in response to VPN events 
# pre-up, up, down, and force-down respectively.
#
# For an example on using these hooks, please see vpn.conf.filled.sample.
