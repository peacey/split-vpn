# Redirect IPv4 and IPv6 DNS to these addresses for VPN-destined traffic.
# Note that many VPN providers redirect DNS going through their VPN network
# to their own DNS servers. Redirection to other IPs might not work on all providers,
# except for DNS redirects to a local address, or rejecting DNS traffic completely.

# IPV4 Format: [IP] to redirect to IP, "DHCP" if using OpenVPN or OpenConnect to obtain
# DNS from DHCP options, or "REJECT" to reject all DNS traffic. "DHCP" is not supported on
# other VPN types like wireguard/external.

# Example: Get DNS from DHCP

# Enable this if you added blackhole routes in the Unifi Settings to prevent Internet
# access at system startup before the VPN script runs. This option removes the blackhole 
# routes to restore Internet access after the killswitch has been enabled. 
# If you do not set this to 1, openvpn will not be able to connect at startup, and your 
# Internet access will never be enabled until you manually remove the blackhole routes.

# Default is "auto" which works with WAN failover and automatically changes the endpoint
